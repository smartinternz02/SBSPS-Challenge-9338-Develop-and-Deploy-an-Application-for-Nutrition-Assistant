Type: Web-Application based on Streamlit Library (Python)
 
INTRODUCTION
This project deals with the classification of fruits and vegetables. It is a simple web application that any user can manage. User must upload a picture of any fruit or vegetable. Our system will automatically classify the image via image recognition and give you a prediction of the name of the fruit or vegetable, which is currently 85% accurate with reference to our dataset being used in the provided source code and we also have provided a calorie counter which helps us to determine the number of calories being consumed when a user intake the uploaded image of the food item. It is a web application, so the user can directly use it in any browser with basic installation of python and its libraries which are included.
 
Technologies and Tools
The Technologies we have used are Streamlit Python, Kaggel Datasets, and basic HTML to reference out Project. Here we have an extended data set and robust collection of data which is specifically trained to recognise and group most fruits and vegetables with a rate of 85% accuracy and 99.9% downtime. We tend to add more data samples in out dataset to make it a near 99% accurate and help our users to have a less hassle-free experience.
